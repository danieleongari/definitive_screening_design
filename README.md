## Installation
```
pip install definitive_screening_design
```

## Example
Generate a Definitive Design screening with three numerical and two 2-levels categoricals factors,
using the protocol presented in the 2013 paper.
The result is a Pandas DataFrame.

```
import definitive_screening_design as dsd
dsd.generate(n_num=3, n_cat=2)
```
